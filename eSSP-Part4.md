# Part 4.  eTRIKS recommended resources

This section points to dedicated and specific documents and specifications that detail further eTRIKS recommendations as to which standards may be used in Data Management Plans (for instance, as described in H2020 data management document) 

## 4.1 eTRIKS - Recommendations for Exchange Format for Clinical Study

### 4.1.1 CDISC Standards
The CDISC suite of data standards have been designed to support various stages of the clinical research process while conforming to common research business processes and regulatory guidelines. Taken collectively, CDISC standards can streamline the medical research process, saving time and cost while improving quality. Use of data standards can increase the value and reusability of data while preserving meaning as data passes through various stages of the research process. The use of CDISC standards at project initiation has been found to save 70 - 90% of time and resources spent prior to first patient enrolled and approximately 75% of the non-patient participation time during the Study Conduct and Analysis stages . CDISC standards reap substantial benefits, qualitative and quantitative, during the entire research process for all types of research studies including academic, nutritional, device, outcomes and regulated research. Standards reduce complexity and generate a coherent data space.

|Protocol Representation Model (PRM), Study Design Model (SDM)

The PRM toolkit gives 30 basic concepts essential for all protocols and is more easily understandable than the full UML model.
 
   	|The Protocol Representation Model (PRM) is a BRIDG-based model and tools for representing standard clinical research protocol elements and relationships. The Study Design Model (SDM-XML) is an XML schema specification based on the Operational Data Model (ODM) for representing clinical study design, including structure, workflow and timing.
PRM supports the interchange (re-use) of information standard to medical/clinical research protocols of any type.  V1.0 supports study tracking and clinical trial registration (CTR) in clinicaltrials.gov, WHO or EudraCT; study design (arms, elements, epochs) and scheduled activities; eligibility criteria.  In Unified Model Language (UML) format as a subset of BRIDG – spreadsheet and templates to ease use are in progress.
 
A common problem with the typical protocol document is that it is not in a useful format for information management and reuse. The PRM is the foundation for a machine readable protocol with such ‘re-use’ being one of the advantages as well as visibility and  comprehensibility of the study design.
 
Clinical Trial data managers should primarily be concerned with obtaining study protocol in such format. When making cross project data comparisons, this summary information is the best way to understand the objectives of and background to the data collection. It enables to categorize studies, to make cross comparisons by identifying like data and the relationships between different datasets. When machine readable protocol representation is absent,  one should be built by the data manager following the proposed standard representation.
 
The PRM gives the added clinical research benefits of:
Increasing transparency of clinical research
Adhering to study registry requirements
Sending information to Ethics Committees
Writing post study clinical reports
Submission of trial summary info to regulators
Machine readable search elements
Avoid poor study designs and further costs and/or study re-runs.
