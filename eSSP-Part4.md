## 4.1 eTRIKS - Recommendations for Exchange Format for Clinical Study

### 4.1.1 CDISC Standards
The CDISC suite of data standards have been designed to support various stages of the clinical research process while conforming to common research business processes and regulatory guidelines. Taken collectively, CDISC standards can streamline the medical research process, saving time and cost while improving quality. Use of data standards can increase the value and reusability of data while preserving meaning as data passes through various stages of the research process. The use of CDISC standards at project initiation has been found to save 70 - 90% of time and resources spent prior to first patient enrolled and approximately 75% of the non-patient participation time during the Study Conduct and Analysis stages . CDISC standards reap substantial benefits, qualitative and quantitative, during the entire research process for all types of research studies including academic, nutritional, device, outcomes and regulated research. Standards reduce complexity and generate a coherent data space. 

|CDISC Standards	|Uses/Value   	|Application   	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|Protocol Representation Model (PRM), Study Design Model (SDM) http://www.cdisc.org/protocol The PRM toolkit gives 30 basic concepts essential for all protocols and is more easily understandable than the full UML model.	| The Protocol Representation Model (PRM) is a BRIDG-based model and tools for representing standard clinical research protocol elements and relationships. The Study Design Model (SDM-XML) is an XML schema specification based on the Operational Data Model (ODM) for representing clinical study design, including structure, workflow and timing. PRM supports the interchange (re-use) of information standard to medical/clinical research protocols of any type.  V1.0 supports study tracking and clinical trial registration (CTR) in clinicaltrials.gov, WHO or EudraCT; study design (arms, elements, epochs) and scheduled activities; eligibility criteria.  In Unified Model Language (UML) format as a subset of BRIDG – spreadsheet and templates to ease use are in progress. A common problem with the typical protocol document is that it is not in a useful format for information management and reuse. The PRM is the foundation for a machine readable protocol with such ‘re-use’ being one of the advantages as well as visibility and  comprehensibility of the study design. Clinical Trial data managers should primarily be concerned with obtaining study protocol in such format. When making cross project data comparisons, this summary information is the best way to understand the objectives of and background to the data collection. It enables to categorize studies, to make cross comparisons by identifying like data and the relationships between different datasets. When machine readable protocol representation is absent,  one should be built by the data manager following the proposed standard representation. The PRM gives the added clinical research benefits of:
  - Increasing transparency of clinical research 
  - Adhering to study registry requirements
  - Sending information to Ethics Committees
  - Writing post study clinical reports
  - Submission of trial summary info to regulators
  - Machine readable search elements
  - Avoid poor study designs and further costs and/or study re-runs.|Planning   	|

|Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) http://www.cdisc.org/cdash |Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization is a specification data collection domains and variables for Case Report Form (CRF) data with standard question text, implementation guidelines, and best practices.   	|Planning/Data Collection   	|
|Laboratory Data Model (LAB) http://www.cdisc.org/lab 	|Specification describing standard content for the acquisition and interchange of clinical laboratory data between central labs and sponsors or contract research organizations (CROs). Vocabulary standard that facilitates exchange of clinical trial laboratory data between central laboratories and study sponsors, CROs or EDC vendors.    	|Planning/Data Collection 	|
|Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) http://www.cdisc.org/sdtm   	|Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) is the general model for representing study tabulation data used in clinical research. The SDTM Implementation Guide (IG) describes domains and variables for data from Human Clinical Trials for Drug Products and Biologics. SDTM is the standard for data tabulations from CRF data from multiple sites for a clinical study; it is the preferred method for providing data to the FDA for regulatory review. Collecting data in CDASH format can eliminate the need to map data to SDTM at the end of the clinical study process. Efficacy domains are in progress and are defined in the SDTM IG, as well as many described and available in the related Therapeutic Area User Guides.  SDTM model and its implementation guidelines 3.2 highlight new specific finding domains: extensions for microbiology specimen, microbiology susceptibility and pharmacogenomics data.   	|Data Tabulation / Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|

|Analysis Dataset Model (ADaM)   	|Analysis Data Model describes fundamental principles and standards for representing analysis datasets and metadata to support statistical analysis and also statistical regulatory reviews. It is the preferred method by FDA statistical reviewers for submitting research data. The ADaM Implementation Guide (IG) describes standard data structures, conventions and variables used with ADaM. A vocabulary standard for analysis datasets to support statistical analysis and also statistical regulatory reviews; preferred method for providing data for review by FDA statistical reviewers.   	| Data Tabulation / Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed  	|

|Define-XML  http://www.cdisc.org/define-xml 	|The XML-based (ODM-based) standard referenced by FDA as the specification for the data definitions for CDISC SDTM, SEND and ADaM datasets and the current mechanism for providing eSubmissions metadata to FDA.   	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|

|Study Design in XML http://www.cdisc.org/study-trial-design  	|The CDISC Study Design Model in XML (SDM-XML) version 1.0 allows organizations to provide rigorous, machine-readable, interchangeable descriptions of the designs of their clinical studies, including treatment plans, eligibility and times and events. As an extension to the existing CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) specification, SDM-XML affords implementers the ease of leveraging existing ODM concepts and re-using existing ODM definitions. SDM-XML defines three key sub-modules – Structure, Workflow, and Timing – permitting various levels of detail in any representation of a clinical study design, while allowing a high degree of authoring flexibility   	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|

|Dataset-XML http://www.cdisc.org/dataset-xml    	|Dataset-XML, released for comment under the name “StudyDataSet-XML”, and renamed to avoid confusion with the CDISC SDS team, is a new standard used to exchange study datasets in an XML format. Dataset-XML supports the interchange of tabular data for clinical research applications using ODM-based XML technologies. The Dataset-XML model is based on the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) standard and should follow the metadata structure defined in the CDISC Define-XML standard.   	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|

| **Specialty Area Standards** 	|   	|   	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Therapeutic Area (TA) Standards 	|Various standards are now being developed to augment the basic CDISC standards that support safety data across essentially any protocol. These new standards are focused on specialty areas to support efficacy data (e.g. Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Tuberculosis) and also Imaging and Devices.   	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|
| Medical Devices http://www.cdisc.org/devices 	|The Study Data Tabulation Model Guide for Medical Devices (SDTMIG-MD) v.1.0 defines recommended standards for the submission of data from clinical trials in which medical devices are used. The document includes seven new domains, developed by a team comprised of medical device experts, CDISC experts, and the FDA (CDRH and CBER), and represents years of work by the members of the CDISC Medical Device team. Training on these seven new domains has been incorporated into the standard SDTM training available through CDISC   	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|
| Pharmacogenomics/Genetics (PGx) http://www.cdisc.org/pharmacogenomics-genetics	|Version 1.0 Provisional of the SDTM Implementation Guide:  Pharmacogenomics/Genetics (SDTMIG-PGx), published 2015-06-01, describes standards to guide the organization, structure and format of gene-related tabulation datasets submitted as part of a product application to a regulatory agency. SDTMIG-PGx is being released for provisional use, since it introduces new variables and constructs that will be added to the forthcoming SDTM v1.5, and to allow operational testing and evaluation of this new standard by the CDISC user community.   	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|
| Specialty Areas http://www.cdisc.org/specialty-areas 	|
Solution Kits for Specialty Areas describe how to use CDISC Foundational Standards to represent content for specific types of trials or certain broad categories of data.  For example, the SDTM Implementation Guides for Medical Devices and Pharmacogenomics/Genetics both began as new specialty area projects before being formally released as independent standards.  Some of these specialty areas are very similar to therapeutic area data standards, but they are not governed under the CFAST initiative so are currently listed separately (though in some cases them may evolve into CFAST projects at a later date.

| Questionnaires, Ratings and Scales (QRS) http://www.cdisc.org/qrs | Questionnaires are named, stand-alone measures designed to provide an assessment of a concept.  Questionnaires have a defined standard structure, format, and content; consist of conceptually related items that are typically scored; and have documented methods for administration and analysis.  Questionnaires consist of defined questions with a defined set of potential answers.  Most often, questionnaires have as their primary purpose the generation of a quantitative statistic to assess a qualitative concept. CDISC publishes standard Questionnaires, Ratings and Scales (QRS) products, which include SDTM Annotated CRFs and Supplements to the SDTMIG along with the related controlled terminology.    	|Preparation to Preservation (and Regulatory Submission if needed)   	|   	



### 4.1.2 SPREC Guidelines for Solid and Fluid Samples:
In the context of clinical trial, it is critical to keep in mind issues related to human tissue and sample preservation and how preanalytical handling of the samples can impact the quality of biological signal derived from samples in downstream workflows. Therefore, eTRIKS WP3 needs to highlight the Standard Preanalytical Coding for Biospecimens: Review and implementation of the Sample PREanalytical Code (SPREC) guidelines produced by the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER). 
The guidelines, which start to gain momentum in the biobanking initiatives, define a coding system allowing for compact reporting of key collection, preanalytical processing, preservation and storage conditions for solid and fluid biological samples.
